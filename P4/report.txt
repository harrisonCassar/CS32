1. None of my classes' implementations have any known bugs/problems.

2. Each and every one of my implementations for the various methods satisfies the big-O requirements given within the specification.

3. High-level pseudocode for two of my methods:
	-Trie's find() method: The find() method essentially works by calling a recursive helper function called "findHelper()":
		-get child of root pointer that corresponds to first of the sequence
		-if exactMatchOnly is true, return findHelper function with alterationDegree set to 0 (meaning allowing 0 alterations in the sequence)
		-else, return findHelper function with alterationDegree set to 1 (meaning allowing still 1 alteration in sequence)
		
		-findHelper() pseudocode:
			-check if passed in nullptr (base case)
				-return empty vector
			-check if reached last node
				-return value(s) at that node
			-if a child has the same label as the next letter in the sequence fragment
				-pass in that child into recursive call with simplifying step of moving one letter later in sequence
				-add returned values to associatedValues vector to be returned later
			-if alterationDegree is greater than 0
				-pass in every other child (if any) into recursive call with alterationDegree as 1 less
				-add all returned values to associatedValues vector to be returned later
			-return associatedValues vector

	-GenomeMatcher's findGenomesWithThisDNA() method:
		-clear passed in matches vector
		-check if valid passed-in minimumLength
		-call Trie.find() method to get all potential matches (and store into vector)
		-iterate through potential matches vector:
			-attempt extraction of full fragment (beyond what was used to search in Trie)
				-if unsuccessful, move onto next potential match
				-if successful:
					-iterate through extraction, checking for valid match length with full inputted fragment (and allowing one alteration per extraction from fragment if SNiPS are allowed)
						-if valid match, check record if it is a longer match than all past matches of that genome, updating record if it is
